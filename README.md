# Seedcracker
Cracks lift/half/structureseeds from structures, pillarseeds, slimechunks and gateways.

Bedrock edition support isnt fully implemented yet

How to use:

Input chunk coordinates of structures,
you need 20 liftable bits to crack a structureseed, only 16 if you have the pillarseed.
Here is a list of structures and their bityield:
```
Desert / Jungle Pyramid: 6 Liftable bits.
Igloo: 6 Liftable bits.
Swamphut: 6 liftable bits.
Outpost: 6 liftable bits.
Shipwreck: 4 liftable bits.
Oceanruin: 4 liftable bits.
Village: 2 Liftable bits.
Trialchamber: 2 Liftable bits.
Trailruin: 2 Liftable bits.
Mansion: 2+ Liftable bits.
Slimechunk: 2 Liftable bits.
```

Note, using too many structures of the same type or only Desert / Jungle Pyramids, Igloos, Swamphuts and Outposts can result in alot of "imposter" seeds, i recommend using non liftable structures aswell to reduce results, If you get too many results the programm might crash.
