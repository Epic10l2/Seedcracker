# Seedcracker
Cracks half/structureseeds from structure/pillarseeds/gateways.

How to use:
Use the Cracker GUI (see https://github.com/Epic10l2/Seedcracker-GUI )

Copy the structure_data.txt (generated by the Cracker GUI) and put it into the same folder as the jar file.

Run the jar file and input the file name, in this case structure_data.txt(this is to account for multiple datasets being in the same folder).
